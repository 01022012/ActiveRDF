== Welcome to ActiveRDF

ActiveRDF is a library for accessing RDF data from Ruby programs. It can be used 
as data layer in Ruby-on-Rails, similar to ActiveRecord (which provides an O/R 
mapping to relational databases). ActiveRDF in RoR allows you to create semantic 
web applications very rapidly. ActiveRDF gives you a Domain Specific Language 
(DSL) for your RDF model: you can address RDF resources, classes, properties, 
etc. programmatically, without queries.

See http://activerdf.org for more information.
