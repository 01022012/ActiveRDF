This is the ActiveRDF adapter to the Jena RDF library.

Features: 
* supports memory, file and database stores; database
  stores can be configured both with datasources and raw connection
  parameters.  Jena currently supports Oracle, MySQL, HSQLDB,
  PostgreSQL, MS SQL, and Derby.
* supports reasoners, including Pellet and the built-in Jena reasoners
* supports Lucene query support in ARQ
  (since LARQ doesn't allow you to add statements
  and reindex only those statements, whenever we've add a statement to a
  triple store, we must rebuild the index at query time)

Requirements: 
* JRuby is required to natively execute Jena
* the application can only use pure ruby gems

License:
included LGPL license (version 2 or later).

Installing and running JRuby: 
=============================

Download the newest JRuby distribution from http://jruby.codehaus.org/

Unpack it somewhere, e.g. /usr/local/jruby

Then set your environement: 

export JRUBY_HOME=/usr/local/jruby
export JAVA_HOM=/path/to/java/home
export PATH=$JRUBY_HOME/bin:$PATH

check if you now have the correct jruby commands in your path: 
which jruby -> /usr/local/jruby/bin/jruby
which gem -> /usr/local/jruby/bin/gem

Now you can install rails and activerdf:
gem install rails --include-dependencies --no-rdoc --no-ri
gem install activerdf --include-dependencies --no-rdoc --no-ri
gem install activerdf_jena --include-dependencies --no-rdoc --no-ri
