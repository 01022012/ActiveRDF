ActiveRDF is a library for accessing RDF data from Ruby programs.
See http://activerdf.m3pe.org for more information.

==License
GPL, see GPL.txt

==Version
0.1

==Installation
1. put this whole directory in your Ruby library path, e.g. /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/activerdf.
2. there is no step 2.

==Usage
1. require 'active_rdf' in your Ruby file, or
2. look at the Unit tests to get an idea,  or
3. read the manual on http://activerdf.m3pe.org

==Problems
See the log file activerdf.log in your temp directory (e.g /tmp or c:\windows\temp).

==Rails
To use ActiveRDF with Rails, you need to change a bit of your Rails 
configuration.  The following works, but is not elegant. Email us if you have a 
better suggestion.

Put the following in config/environment.rb
		----
		require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'boot')

		Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
			# Settings in config/environments/* take precedence those specified here
			
			# Skip frameworks you're not going to use
			config.frameworks -= [:active_record]

			# Add additional load paths for your own custom dirs
			config.load_paths += %W( "#{RAILS_ROOT}/lib/activerdf" )

			# TODO find out the right version: development/testing/etc.
			yaml = YAML::load_file config.database_configuration_file
			yaml = yaml['development']
			require 'active_rdf'
			NodeFactory.connection yaml.symbolize_keys
			nil
		end
