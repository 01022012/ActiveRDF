This is the sesame 2 adapter for ActiveRDF. 

currently the major benefits of using ActiveRDF with the Sesame Adapter are:
 * good speed, because java code is used for all the heavy lifting of a triple store
 * rdf schema inferencing
 * support for quads/named graphs (as soon as I get around to implementing them in the adapter)

disadvantages:
 * installation of jruby and manual setting of the java CLASSPATH are required
 * no owl inferencing (but all the other adapters also dont have this)
 * no support for a database backend

It uses Sesame 2 Alpha 4, which is distributed as a jar together with this gem.
