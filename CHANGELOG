== activerdf (1.2.2) Tue, 13 Feb 2007 19:40:19 +0000
  * gems published automatically from Rakefile 
  * added support for namespaced attributes:
    eyal.foaf::name or eyal.foaf.name (do not require predicate lookup)
  * minor changes to activerdf loader and documentation

== activerdf (1.2.1) Tue, 30 Jan 2007 19:09:59 +0000
  * added ancestors when looking at domain/range in Resource#method_missing
    (makes foaf.name='eyal' work without reasoning because foaf:name defined in 
    superclass, but does not work when reasoning enabled)
  * activerdf loader uses 'gem' instead of deprecated 'require_gem'
